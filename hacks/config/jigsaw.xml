This grabs a screen image, carves it up into a jigsaw puzzle,
shuffles it, and then solves the puzzle.  This works especially well
when you feed it an external video signal instead of letting it grab
the screen image (actually, I guess this is generally true...)  When
it is grabbing a video image, it is sometimes pretty hard to guess
what the image is going to look like once the puzzle is solved.
