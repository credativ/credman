Comment=This takes an image, divides it into a grid, and then randomly shuffles the squares around as if it was one of those annoying ``16-puzzle'' games, where there is a grid of squares, one of which is missing. I hate trying to solve those puzzles, but watching one permute itself is more amusing. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
