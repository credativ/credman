Name=Hypercube
Comment=This displays 2D projections of the sequence of 3D objects which are the projections of the 4D analog to the cube: as a square is composed of four lines, each touching two others; and a cube is composed of six squares, each touching four others; a hypercube is composed of eight cubes, each touching six others. To make it easier to visualize the rotation, it uses a different color for the edges of each face. Don't think about it too long, or your brain will melt. Written by Joe Keane, Fritz Mueller, and Jamie Zawinski. See also the "polytopes" hack for a more general version of this using OpenGL.
