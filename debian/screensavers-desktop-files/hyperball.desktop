Name=Hyperball
Comment=Hyperball is to hypercube as dodecahedron is to cube: this displays a 2D projection of the sequence of 3D objects which are the projections of the 4D analog to the dodecahedron. Technically, it is a "120 cell polytope." Written by Joe Keane. See also the "polytopes" hack for a more general version of this using OpenGL.
